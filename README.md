# Project Description
We are designing a Dog Keyboard for our client Joelle Alcaidinho.
This repository is for version-controlling our iOS app.

The app will act as a remote controller to the physical keyboard. The user will be able to set sounds, quiet-hours, and export data to the inputted email address.
